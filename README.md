# [NO LONGER DEVELOPED] Coursera Machine Learning by Andrew Ng
In this repository I implemented few assignments in python. (No octave to python library)

# Acknowledgement
I started learning python by learning machine learning at the same time and I may have a lot of inefficient/ugly/... codes here. 
There are lots of good repos out there for this coarse, please use them.

# Features
1. All optional exercises have been done
2. All computations done in vectorized form
